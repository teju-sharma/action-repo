# action-repo

This repository was created as part of the TechStaX Developer Assessment.

Its purpose is to simulate GitHub actions such as:

- `PUSH` — Committing and pushing to the main branch.
- `PULL_REQUEST` — Creating a new branch and submitting a pull request.
- `MERGE` — Merging the pull request into the main branch.

These actions are intended to trigger webhooks received by the companion repository [`webhook-repo`](https://github.com/teju-sharma/webhook-repo), which logs and displays the events in real-time.
